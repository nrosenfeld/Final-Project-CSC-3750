<p>My son Stephen was falling behind in school. He didn't have any real learning disability, but he just lacked self-confidence. After I sent
him to LASA, the headstart it gave him on the next year's subjects gave him the confidence he needs. We sent him back for the next three years
and we are really happy with the results! Next year, we're sending him off to college and we really thank LASA for that!</p></div>

<p>I can't recommend LASA enough! I refer all kinds of students there; those who are struggling, those who are just making it, and - yes - those
who are excelling. I think every student can benefit from spending a couple hours reinforcing and enhancing what they
learned in the previous year and developing skills for the next year. The recreational activities are also really important to keep them active 
through the summer. Also, they really enjoy learning in a more laid-back environment. It's the perfect complement to a school year!

<p>I was a struggling student. I just didn't find anything at school interesting. I would have just spent a summer vegging with my phone, but my parents
thought that was a really bad idea (can you imagine!). So, they sent me to LASA. I went <b>really</b> reluctantly. Well, their recreational stuff
was pretty fun, and their classes were a whole lot easier do deal with than the full school day I have during the year. I actually started to feel 
the accomplishment in doing something academic. The headstart it gave me on the next year made last year's school year so much more tolerable!
