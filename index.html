	enjoyable. We balance a couple of hours of classes in the morning with access to a variety of healthy and supervised
	recreational activities. The combination of both keeps young men and women coming <b>willingly</b> and gives them
	a boost on the upcoming year!</p></div>

	<p>We do offer need-based scholarships. On the application form, click the box that indicates that you are requesting a scholarship and we
	will contact you about it. Besides the scholarships that we offer, there are many available from several community organizations.
	<ul>
	<li><a href="https://mo211.myresourcedirectory.com/index.php/education">The United Way of St Louis County</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.caastlc.org/home-2/contact-us/">The Community Action Agency of St. Louis County</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.stlarchs.org/">Area Resources for Community and Human Services (ARCHES)</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://stlouiscountymo.gov/">St. Louis County Board of Education</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://stlgives.org/">St. Louis Community Foundation</a></li></ul>
	If you are applying for a scholarship, either from us 
	or from any other organization, it is best to apply first so that you know how much the amount is that needs to be subsidized. Don't worry, 
	filling out the form doesn't obligate you to pay anything. You owe nothing until enrollment is complete.</a></p>
