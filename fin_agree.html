<p>By clicking on the box you agree to the following terms:
<ol>
<li>I agree that LASA has no financial obligation to extend their program to me. If, for whatever reason, they are unable
to provide the program agreed to, I have no claim other then the refund of whatever funds I paid for that program</li>
<li>By checking on this form, I am not yet obligating myself in payment. However, I agree that, upon confirmation of my child's enrollment, I will
be responsible for payment.</li>
<li>I agree that I will verify the availability of whatever scholarships I am using to help pay for LASA <b>before</b> I confirm my child's
enrollment. After he/she is enrolled, I am obligated to pay whether or not the scholarship is paid.</li>
