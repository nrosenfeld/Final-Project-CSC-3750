	<p>We were started in 1994 by the late educator Dr. Arthur Beilinson. Until <span class="abbrName"><abbr>LASA</abbr></class>, summer schools were used as a
	punishment for students who didn't learn well enough during the year. Dr Beilinson, then a secondary educator with 30 years of
	experience, felt that all students were poorly served by being disengaged from their studies for three months in the summer. He felt that all
	students would do better if they kept involved in their studies throughout the summer.</p>
	<p>However, he also felt that the summer needed to be a break - to an extent. Thus, the idea of <span class = "abbrName"><abbr>LASA</abbr></class>:
	To provide engaging courses in the main subject areas while balancing them with exciting and enjoyable recreational activites to keep it fun</p>
	<p>Over the almost 30 years that <span class ="abbrName">LASA<abbr></abbr></class> has been serving the metro St. Louis area, it has grown
	from a group of 30 students in its first year to an enrollment of 400 young men and women this last summer.</p>
